# IoT data collection stack

This project is used to automate the creation of stack necessary to receive, process, store and visualize data
received from distributed IoT devices [more here](https://github.com/Beraton/esp_weather).

Project also contains special script `gen_client_ssl_cert.sh` which creates SSL certificates used by clients to authenticate to Telegraf.
